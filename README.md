Each file contains its own description for you.

CeleitaN_Multiple Variables Map.pdf: This file is a comprehensive study on the spatial analysis of various locations within a specific urban planning context. By the use of ArcGIS PRO I analyze and compare different locations based on various factors, offering a detailed understanding of each area's strengths and weaknesses for better planning strategies.

CeleitaN_ModelBuilder_SiteConstraints.pdf: This document showcases a ModelBuilder created in ArcGIS PRO. The ModelBuilder helps in identifying and visualizing site constraints, geopraphic tools, and other factors that may impact urban planning analysis. 

Conceptual Site Plan of an Existing Property in Barrie.pdf: This file presents a conceptual site plan proposal of the property, which shows the general layout of areas of development. It includes the arrangement of buildings, green spaces, access ways, and amenity areas. This file helps establish a conceptual framework for the future development of the property and facilitates decision-making in terms of zoning and land use.
